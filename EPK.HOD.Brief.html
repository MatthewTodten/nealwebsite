<div>
    <p>HOUSE OF DIRECTION was originally presented as a multi evening, multi-disciplinary exhibition featuring musical compositions, paintings, and choreography by Neal Todten. The exhibition was presented in November ’23 at Alterspace ; a lofted French Quarter contemporary art gallery in New Orleans, LA. The project was in direct response to an experience working with La Monte Young and Marian Zazeela’s <i>Dream House</i> in NYC; a permanent immersive exhibition/performance space. Neal Todten applied this concept to his burgeoning body of work as composer and visual artist. The project, aptly titled “House of Direction”, reflects this connection with iconography used in his painted canvases. </p>

    <p>The opening performance was programed for solo organ performance by Neal Todten accompanying six dancers performing original choreography also by Neal Todten. Both the music and dance were long-form structured improvisational pieces utilizing durational, repetition focused elements. The closing performance was a concert for Neal Todten’s “Tanz Orkestra”, performing compositions by Neal Todten within the exhibition space.</p>


    <p>The static character of the exhibition space was marked by a droning tape loop played on a reel to reel recording machine to accompanying the display of three large canvased paintings.</p>

    <p>The exhibition debuted a new painting by Neal Todten, The Wind, his largest canvas to date inspired by Andy Warhol’s <i>Mao</i> - paintings. Measuring roughly 14x28 ft, the piece incorporates repeated use of black arrows on a white background, set forth in cascading patterns whirling across the canvas in several slow changing directions.Two previous paintings utilizing similar textures were displayed beside the work.</p>

	<p>Shortly after the closing of the exhibition, a filming was organized to capture the music, dance, and artworks displayed in <i>House of Direction</i>. This project was a collaboration between Neal Todten’s body of work and cinematographer A. Hennen Payne, presenting the material in a creative cinematic medium. Payne and Todten worked together to organize the material and outline footage to be captured on 16mm b&w film with a state of the art steady-camera operation rigging. What stands is an experimental short film featuring the music and multidisciplinary work of Neal Todten through the cinematographic lens of A. Hennen Payne, sharing the title <i>House of Direction</i>, 2024. </p>
