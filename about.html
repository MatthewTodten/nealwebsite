 <h1 class="name">All About Neal</h1>

	
 <h1 class="header_options">Early Experiments</h1>

<div>
    <p>Neal Todten is a composer/performer based in New Orleans, LA working with experimental musical mediums. Starting in 2018 he began producing concerts featuring contemporary classical composers at spaces within the New Orleans DIY artist community. In doing so he discovered a formula for further exploration of experimental forms of music in addition to an outlet to compose new works, all the while finding a fresh audience.  </p>

    <p>In 2022 he launched a three-part music series titled <i>MINIMALISM</i>, hosted at the Happyland Theater in New Orleans. The productions featured performances of works by Steve Reich and Terry Riley, including premieres of new works by Neal Todten.</p>
	
    <p>As a follow-up to the three-part series, in 2023 a presentation was given at the Happyland Theater featuring early music of the Philip Glass Ensemble, as well as the premiere of a new piece for the three saxophone/three organ ensemble composed by Neal Todten, titled <i>Music In Sweet Motion.</i></p>
   
	<p>Neal Todten's music has taken on aspects of the often minimalist concert productions, but also incorporates his experience as an New Orleans musician; including elements of improvisation, expressive melodic content and a deep exploration of syncopation. Neal is particularly interested in the intersection of composition and improvisation, finding ways to extend the musical possibilities of listening and performing experiences.</p>
    
	<p>As a performing ensemble, Neal Todten keeps his TodtenTanz Orkestra to explore new musical works, consisting orchestrated horn and rhythm sections performing longform instrumental compositions while incorporating improvisation. In May 2023 with the <i>Broadcast From the End of the Universe</i>, he began to explore spoken word elements of performance.</p>

	<p>Through his produced concert series Neal has composed pieces for solo piano, solo organ, six pianos, large ensemble, and three organs and three saxophones.</p>
	
	<p>By producing concerts as independent productions, performances have become a medium onto themselves, with Neal exploring stage design, promotional/graphic design, costume design, and choreography. </p>
	
	<p>His work can be characterized by his longstanding interest in underground and DIY cultures paring with his dedicated musical study as a pianist, composer, and percussionist. While growing up in Cleveland, Ohio, DIY communities became a focal point to find local artists and niche musical styles. While being steeped in these communities he received a BA in Music Composition from Cleveland State University where he became familiar with the work of experimental composers as well as developing his technique as a musician. His work as a composer/performer is a reflection of these two worlds, exploring self-made personal creative expression in all aspects of performance while seeking out innovative musical forms. </p>
	
	<p>Neal Todten has presented his work at the Happyland Theater, AlterSpace Gallery, The Twilight Room at The Allways Lounge, and the Mudlark Public Theater in New Orleans, LA as well as the Living Gallery in Brooklyn, NY.</p>
