 <h1 class="name">All About Neal</h1>

	
 <h1 class="header_options">DIY Composer in New Orleans</h1>

<div>
    <p>Neal Todten is a composer/performer based in New Orleans, LA. Starting in 2018 he began producing concerts of contemporary classical music at spaces within the New Orleans DIY artist community. In doing so he discovered a formula for further study of experimental forms of music while finding an outlet write new pieces, all while finding a fresh audience.  </p>
   
	<p>His music has taken on the aspects of his often minimalist concert productions, but also incorporates his experience as an New Orleans musician, including elements of improvisation, expressive melodic content and a deep exploration of syncopation. Neal is particularly interested in the intersection of composition and improvisation, finding ways to extend the musical possibilities of listening and performing experiences.</p>
    
	<p>Neal keeps his working-titled TodtenTanz Orkestra as his performing ensemble to explore his musical works, consisting orchestrated horn section with rhythm section performing longform instrumental compositions while incorporating improvisation. In May 2023 with his Broadcast From the End of the Universe, he began to explore spoken word elements of performance.</p>

	<p>Through his produced concert series he has composed pieces for solo piano, solo organ, six pianos, large ensemble, and three organs and three saxophones.</p>
	
	<p>By producing concerts as independent productions, performances have become a medium onto themselves, with Neal exploring stage design, promotional/graphic design, and even costume design. </p>
	
	<p>His work can be characterized by his longstanding interest in DIY/underground cultures paring with his dedicated musical study as a pianist, composer, and percussionist. While growing up in Cleveland, Ohio, DIY communities became a focal point to find local artists and niche musical styles. While being steeped in these communities he received a BA in Music Composition from Cleveland State University where he became familiar with the work of experimental composers as well as developing his technique as a musician. His work as a composer/performer is a reflection of these two worlds, exploring self-made personal creative expression in all aspects of a performance space while seeking out innovative musical forms. </p>
	
	<p>Neal Todten has presented his work at the Happyland Theater and the Mudlark Public Theater in New Orleans, LA and the Living Gallery in Brooklyn, NY.</p>
